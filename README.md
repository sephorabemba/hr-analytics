# HR Analytics: Employee Turnover Prediction

Analysis and prediction of employee turnover on the "Hr Analytics Job Prediction" Kaggle dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict employee turnover on the "Hr Analytics Job Prediction" [Kaggle dataset](
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction) using
employee survey results and employee characteristics such as tenure, performance, number of projects, etc.

To predict the turnover effectively, we built a Gradient Boosting model that achieved an average precision of 0.95 on
unseen data.

## Business Understanding

Retaining talents in a company is important to build steady businesses. Many companies struggle with preventing
turnover due to a lack of understanding the underlying factors and not addressing the core problems.

High turnover situations must be solved as they cause disruption and are very costly. They can represent one to two
times an employee’s annual salary (source: [Josh Bersin - Deloitte](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130816200159-131079-employee-retention-now-a-big-issue-why-the-tide-has-turned/)).

## Data Understanding

The dataset has 9 columns and 1 categorical target `left`.

| Column name           | Type  | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| satisfaction_level    | int64 | The employee’s self-reported satisfaction level [0-1]             |
| last_evaluation       | int64 | Score of employee's last performance review [0–1]                 |
| number_project        | int64 | Number of projects employee contributes to                        |
| average_monthly_hours | int64 | Average number of hours employee worked per month                 |
| time_spend_company    | int64 | How long the employee has been with the company (years)           |
| work_accident         | int64 | Whether or not the employee experienced an accident while at work |
| left                  | int64 | Whether or not the employee left the company                      |
| promotion_last_5years | int64 | Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years      |
| department            | str   | The employee's department                                         |
| salary                | str   | The employee's salary (low, medium, or high)                      |

The dataset is imbalanced with a turnover of 16.6%.

## Modeling and Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics

We picked the `average precision` as our main evaluation metric for the following reasons:

- The business problem requires to spot as many risky employees as possible to be able to retain them (cf. high recall).
- It also requires to understand perfectly why the rest of the employees want to stay to put in place a lean action
  plan. Therefore, it's also important to minimize false positives  (cf. high precision).
- Average precision gives stable insights on how a model performs balancing minimizing false positive and negatives at
  different decision thresholds. It's especially useful for imbalanced datasets like the one at hand.

### Cross Validation and Model Selection

* We performed a Grid Search cross validation to evaluate different models with different hyperparameter sets, including
  ensemble, tree-based and regression models.
* The Gradient Boosting algorithm was selected as the best algorithm with a best model achieving an average precision of
  0.95.

## Conclusion

Employee satisfaction, work load, tenure and performance evaluation strongly impact employee turnover.

The leadership team should put in place actions to tackle these areas. Here are a few data-driven recommendations:

- Implement regular employee feedback sessions to address concerns and improve job satisfaction.
- Provide professional development opportunities and clear career paths.
- Introduce flexible work arrangements for better work-life balance.

We've created a Streamlit App to:

* Test the model.
* Summarize the story of this dataset.
* Provide customized recommendations to decrease employee turnover.
