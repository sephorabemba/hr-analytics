summary = f""" ### Business case 
Clover Electrical Inc. is a tech company specialized in sustainable electronics. The 
company has been suffering from an increasing turnover rate for over a year now. The past period, it has stagnated 
around a whooping 16%.
 
Leadership has tried to set up actions but they were unsuccessful. They seemingly didn't address the core issues.

To make more data-driven decisions, they've sent an employee survey to the company to better understand the situation
and target the right problems this time on.

The leadership team has asked the Data team to analyze the results and build a solution to predict employee turnover,
uncover its main factors and make recommendations on how to reduce employee turnover.

### Goals
* Predict turnover with a 90% average precision.
* Uncover impactful insights and make recommendations to increase employee retention.

### The approach
The data team has thoroughly analyzed the survey data and has come up with a HR analytics software powered with AI to
solve this business problem (*Use 55 template*).
